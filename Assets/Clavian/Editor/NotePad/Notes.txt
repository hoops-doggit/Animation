Note to self about mixamo:

Mixamo packs have forward motion on by default. EG I had to re-download all of the clips with "In Place" ticked.

The scale of your fbx animation clips needs to be set to the exact same settings as the scale as your model fbx

Also Mixamo doesn't add a root joint when it auto-rigs something (the root joint is a joint which typically sits at 0,0,0 and all other bones are parented to it). Unity prefers root joints when setting up Avatars.
